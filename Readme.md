Meat Processor

Synopsis

This app consists of a lightweight, meat-themed word processor and server which allow for saving documents onto the cloud and real-time collaboration. 

Motivation

Meat Processor was made to work on my skills and explore areas like network sockets, parallel programming, spell check, and meat-themed GUI's.

Installation

This project must be run inside of Eclipse. To enable full server functionality ensure mySQL is installed and run the DatabaseSetup.sql script. 
Run MeatServer first then launch as many MeatClientGUI's as you'd like for different users.
A MeatCLientGUI can also be run independently in offline mode without any server-enabled features.
