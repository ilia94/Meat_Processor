Meat Processor

Synopsis

The Meat Processor application consists of a lightweight word processor and server which allow for cloud file-storage, document sharing, and real-time collaboration. The client includes a spell check features which can be customized via provided word list and keyboard configuration files. The server application and mySQL database handle account creation, logins, cloud-file storage, and real-time document collaboration. All this is wrapped inside of a beautiful, meat-themed GUI.

Motivation

I made Meat Processor to improve on my Java programming skills and explore areas like network sockets, parallel programming, parsing, and meat-themed GUI's.

Installation

This project must be imported and run inside of Eclipse. To enable full server functionality ensure mySQL is installed and run the DatabaseSetup.sql script. 
Run MeatServer first then launch as many MeatClientGUI's as you'd like for different users.
A MeatCLientGUI can also be run independently in offline mode without any server-enabled features.
